# Releasing Updates

Once your app is configured and distributed to users, and you've made JavaScript or asset changes, it's time to release them as OTA updates.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

## Prerequisites

Before releasing updates:

1. ✅ Your app must be published to the App Store/Play Store with the DOTA SDK integrated
2. ✅ Deployment keys must be configured in your app code
3. ✅ You must have generated the JavaScript bundle and assets

See [Bundle Generation](/dota/sdk/bundle-generation) for creating bundles.

## Release Methods

Choose one of the following:

<Tabs groupId="release-method">
  <TabItem value="ui" label="Web Panel (UI)" default>

Best when:
- You prefer a guided UI and visual confirmations
- Non‑technical teammates need to publish
- You want built‑in charts/monitoring as you release

Steps:
- Open the [DOTA Web Panel](/dota/web-panel/overview)
- Select your app and deployment (e.g., Staging/Production)
- Upload your bundle and assets
- Configure rollout (optional)
- Publish the update

Full walkthrough: [Web Panel guide](/dota/web-panel/overview)

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="cli" label="CLI (Terminal)">

Best when:
- You automate releases in CI/CD
- You need repeatable, scripted workflows
- You want granular options (rollout, semver ranges, patch, Brotli)

Quick start commands:

<Tabs groupId="pm-cli-quick">
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn" default>

Install CLI (project):

```bash
yarn add --dev @d11/delivr-cli
```

Check current session:

```bash
yarn code-push-standalone whoami
```

If not logged in, see the login steps in the [Installation guide](/dota/cli/installation#access-key-and-authentication).

Release to Production (100% rollout):

```bash
yarn code-push-standalone release <AppName> ./codepush 1.0.0 -d Production -des "Release"
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="npm" label="npm">

Install CLI (project):

```bash
npm install --save-dev @d11/delivr-cli
```

Check current session:

```bash
npm run code-push-standalone -- whoami
```

If not logged in, see the login steps in the [Installation guide](/dota/cli/installation).

Release to Production (100% rollout):

```bash
npm run code-push-standalone -- release <AppName> ./codepush 1.0.0 -d Production -des "Release"
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

For complete options, examples, and best practices (rollout, semver ranges, patch bundles, Brotli, promotions), see the detailed guide: [CLI Release Management](/dota/cli/release-management).
