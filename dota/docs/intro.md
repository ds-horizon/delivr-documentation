# DOTA Documentation

**DOTA (Delivr Over-The-Air)** enables seamless OTA updates for React Native applications. Push JavaScript and asset updates instantly to your users without waiting for app store approval.

## What is DOTA?

DOTA provides a complete ecosystem for managing and deploying OTA updates to your React Native apps:

- **🚀 Instant Updates**: Deploy bug fixes and features without app store delays
- **🏗️ Self-Hostable**: Run locally, on-premise, or in your preferred cloud
- **🔌 Flexible Architecture**: Plugin-based system for storage, database, and authentication
- **📊 Full Control**: Web dashboard, CLI tools, and comprehensive API
- **🎯 Targeted Deployments**: Deploy to specific user segments, versions, or environments
- **🔒 Secure**: Enterprise-grade security with role-based access control

## Getting Started

The DOTA ecosystem consists of four main components:

### [SDK (React Native Module)](/dota/sdk/overview)
The React Native module that you integrate into your mobile app to receive OTA updates.

### [Server (Backend API)](/dota/server/overview)
The core backend service that manages apps, deployments, and update delivery.

### [Web Panel (Dashboard)](/dota/web-panel/overview)
A modern web interface for managing applications, deployments, and monitoring releases.

### [CLI (Command Line Interface)](/dota/cli/overview)
A powerful command-line tool for deploying updates from your terminal or CI/CD pipelines.

## Quick Start Guide

### 🚀 Launch Everything (5 minutes)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ds-horizon/delivr.git

./launch_script.sh
```

Then follow these steps:

1. **Create your app** in the Web Panel (http://localhost:3000)
2. **Install the SDK** in your React Native app
3. **Generate deployment keys** and integrate them
4. **Deploy updates** using the CLI or Web Panel
